# Barracuda Trial Plugin

A RuneLite plugin to help navigate Barracuda Trials by displaying optimal routes and avoiding obstacles.
Uses A\* pathfinding to handle real-time navigation around moving lightning clouds and static rocks while preferring speed boost tiles

Supports:
* Tempor Tantrum: All three difficulties (I think - latest refactor leaves it untested).
* Jibbly Jive: First two difficulties
