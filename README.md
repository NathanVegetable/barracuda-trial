# Barracuda Trial Plugin

A RuneLite plugin to help navigate Barracuda Trials by displaying optimal routes and avoiding obstacles.
Uses A\* pathfinding to handle real-time navigation around moving lightning clouds and static rocks while preferring speed boost tiles

Supports all three difficulties of Tempor Tantrum trials (I think - latest refactor leaves it untested).
Supports first two difficulties of Jibbly Jive.
